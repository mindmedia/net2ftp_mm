Introduction.
*************
This is a module for allowing users to configure config files
for accessing a ftp server

It can be configured to use mysql in settings.inc.php. Run create_tables.sql to build tables. 
Add in new skins to give a new skin name in this config file.

The settings for ftp servers can be configured in settings_authorizations.inc.php. 


Installation
********************
Refer to INSTALL.txt.

For linux, place files from the folder (files_to_upload) into /var/www/html/net2ftp. 
To start the web, type "http://localhost/net2ftp in the URL address of a browser.


Copyrights:

Refer to LICENSE.txt.


UPGRADE
*******
net2ftp cannot really be "upgraded" - simply delete the old files on your web
server, and follow the installation instructions above.

If you are using a database for logging, drop the old tables and create new
ones following the installation instructions. This will delete the existing
statistics.

If you need help, post a message on the net2ftp forum:

Enjoy!
